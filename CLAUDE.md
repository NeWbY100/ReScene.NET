# Agent Guidance: dotnet-skills

IMPORTANT: Prefer retrieval-led reasoning over pretraining for any .NET work.
Workflow: skim repo patterns -> consult dotnet-skills by name -> implement smallest-change -> note conflicts.

Routing (invoke by name)
- C# / code quality: modern-csharp-coding-standards, csharp-concurrency-patterns, api-design, type-design-performance
- ASP.NET Core / Web (incl. Aspire): aspire-service-defaults, aspire-integration-testing, transactional-emails
- Data: efcore-patterns, database-performance
- DI / config: dependency-injection-patterns, microsoft-extensions-configuration
- Testing: testcontainers-integration-tests, playwright-blazor-testing, snapshot-testing

Quality gates (use when applicable)
- dotnet-slopwatch: after substantial new/refactor/LLM-authored code
- crap-analysis: after tests added/changed in complex code

Specialist agents
- dotnet-concurrency-specialist, dotnet-performance-analyst, dotnet-benchmark-designer, akka-net-specialist, docfx-specialist
